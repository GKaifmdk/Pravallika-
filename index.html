    <h1 id="pravi3">PERFUMES</h1>
    <p>Perfumes are scented products crafted to enhance personal fragrance and create a lasting impression. They are made from a blend of essential oils, aroma compounds, and solvents, which combine to produce unique scents. Perfumes come in various concentrations, such as eau de parfum, eau de toilette, and cologne, with higher concentrations offering longer-lasting fragrances. Each perfume typically has layers called notes – top, middle, and base – that unfold over time to reveal a complex scent profile. Perfumes can evoke emotions, boost confidence, and express personality, making them an integral part of personal style and self-expression. With an array of options, from floral to woody, spicy to citrus, there's a scent for every mood, occasion, and individual preference.
